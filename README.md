A comprehensive implementation of **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)** optimized for consumer-grade hardware, specifically the **RTX 4060 with 8GB VRAM**. This project demonstrates that high-quality AI alignment research is accessible without enterprise-level computational resources.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository implements a complete RLHF pipeline that transforms a base language model into an aligned, helpful assistant through three key stages:

1. **🎓 Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**: Teaching the model conversational patterns and desired response styles
2. **🏆 Reward Modeling**: Training multiple quantized reward models to evaluate response quality  
3. **🎯 PPO Alignment**: Using Proximal Policy Optimization to align the model with human preferences

### 🔬 Research Focus

Our primary research question: **How does reward model quantization (bf16, int8, int4) affect the quality of RLHF alignment on consumer hardware?**

This work provides quantitative analysis of the "alignment tax" - the computational cost and quality trade-offs when performing RLHF on resource-constrained environments.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Memory Optimization Strategies

1. **Gradient Accumulation**: Effective batch size through multiple micro-batches
2. **LoRA Adapters**: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning reduces memory requirements
3. **Mixed Precision**: Strategic use of bf16 for speed without losing stability
4. **CPU Offloading**: Reward models run on CPU during PPO to maximize GPU memory for policy
